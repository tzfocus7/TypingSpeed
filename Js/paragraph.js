    "Alfred Lord Tennyson wrote this poem as a requiem for his college friend Arthur Henry Hallam who died suddenly at the age of 22. The poem was published almost 21 after Arthur’s death and tracks the journey of Tennyson’s grief. The length of the poem, 2892 lines, adds to the meaning by emphasizing the greatness of the poet’s sadness and how Tennyson continued to mourn his friend throughout his life. The poem includes iconic lines that have become common cliches, like: “‘Tis better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all.” The poem is a good example of British Victorian poetry, both in terms of meter and form. But it also emphasizes friendship as a relationship as important and meaningful as romantic love.",
    "It’s hard (maybe impossible) to write about long poems without mentioning this poem by Walt Whitman. It contains famous quotations such as “I am large, I contain multitudes” and “These are the days that must happen to you” and so many more. While these iconic sayings are short, the poem is 1,349 lines in total. Long poems are traditionally poems that tell stories. But Whitman breaks with tradition. Instead, he uses his conversational, stream of consciousness style to ruminate on the ideas of self, identity, and nature. Long, epic poems celebrate a hero who stands out from the rest of a community. But in his poem, Whitman asserts the importance of the common person. He highlights the significant and heroism that exists inside every individual just by existing.",
    "At over 10,000 lines this 19th century poem definitely qualifies as a long one. Elizabeth Barrett Browning was very interested in trying to write an entirely female epic poem. Instead of the traditional 12 books found in the Aeneid and Paradise Lost, Browning chose to include nine books, which some scholars view as a nod to the nine months of pregnancy and other see as a reference to the Sibylline Books. Through blank verse Browning produces a fictional first person account of the title character Aurora Leigh growing up and struggling to find her identity as an artist and poet. Through both form and content, Browning argues for female space and recognition in the poetry sphere.",
    "At 434 lines, this is one of the shorter long poems on this list. I still believe it is substantial enough to belong in this group. It’s also been cited as an inspiration for several other long poems and many consider it to be one of the most important poems of the 20th century. It begins with an allusion to another famous long poem, The Canterbury Tales, starting: “April is the cruelest month.” What follows is a mishmash of hundreds of quotations and allusions from other poems and literature, mixed in with Arthurian legends and disjointed moments of contemporary British life. The Modernist style makes you work hard at understanding the poem…something that can make the poem feel even longer.",
    "“Good morning, daddy! / Ain’t you heard?” begins the 75 page long poem describing a 24 hour period of time in 1950s Harlem. The poem also ends with these two lines. But in between the poet describes the daily rhythms, hopes, dreams, disappointments, and subjugations of the Black residents in this New York neighborhood. While the book is broken up into 91 titled sections, the author stated his intentions for the book to be read as one continuous poem rather than a collection. Inspired by Jazz music, one section begins where the other left off. And the different music styles also influence the form and style of writing within. One section titled “Harlem” is probably the most famous part of the poem.",
    "Annie Allen is a story told in verse about a Black girl growing up. Gwendolyn Brooks won the Pulitzer Prize for the collection in 1950, becoming the first Black poet to receive the award. Annie’s life is broken into three sections. The middle section, “The Anniad” is often described as a mock epic. The tongue in cheek title references Homer’s Iliad. It describe’s Annie’s quest to fall in love in the midst of America going to war. And the poem simultaneously mocks the machismo of traditional epic poetry while remaining a genuine exploration of emotions. Annie’s quest to hold onto her grand ideas of love throughout the poem is elevated by its literary connection with the hero’s journey. And she goes through a transformation of consciousness by the end of the 43 stanzas. ",
    "At 514 lines, this is another of the shorter long poems I’ve included on this list. At 17 pages it definitely doesn’t feel short! And the poem can be described as nothing less than ambitious for the number of topics and themes it tries to weave together through this rumination on death, love, and dehumanization. Judy Grahan is an important figure in both feminist and queer poetry movements. This landmark poem starts with the narrator viewing a fatal motor cycle accident on San Fransisco’s Bay Bridge. What follows are differing recollections of death, police violence a brutality, and homophobia. But throughout, almost struggling against this despair, are assertions of the power of love.",
    "This book length epic poem uses allusions to Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey to capture a story about the displacement and suffering of Native Africans and Indigenous Americans as a result of European colonization and enslavement. The poem is 8,000 lines long, and unlike most epic poetry jumps around in both perspective and time period. The form varies but is mostly composed of loose combination of three line rhyming stanzas, also known as Terza Rima. I say loose combination, because Walcott allows himself to break the form about as often as he follows it. The undertaking of this large epic was considered a huge risk in 1990 when he published it. But now the work is considered the masterpiece of Nobel Prize–winning, Caribbean poet. ",
    "This 55 page work also uses poetry to tell a story through multiple perspectives. However, this time it is the character Rose imagining the voices of her older siblings Sister and Preacher. Rose is the one who made it out of their 1920s rural tobacco farm. This is something both her brother and sister desperately wanted and never achieved. As the only surviving family member she looks back on her childhood and what the farm meant to her family. Rose’s survivor’s guilt comes through on the page, as well as Sister and Preacher’s bleak lives filled with suppressed longing. It is not a happy story. But it’s certainly a feat to tell a complete Faulkner-esque story within the confines of an epic poem.",
    "In this award-winning, book-length poem, Claudia Rankine contemplates the Black American experience and delivers a biting critique of racism. The lyrical blocks of prose poem address issues ranging from the poet’s experience with microaggressions, the racist treatment of Serena Williams, the murders of James Craig Anderson and Trayvon Martin, the verbal error during Obama’s first inauguration, racism and language, and more. Between the sections of writing are photographs, drawings, paintings, and screen grabs depicting Black life. This poem is in your face and unapologetic while explaining the everyday racism that is ever present in a “post-racial” United States.",
    "A long, legendary poem, written in 1938, about the illness of a group of miners in Gauley Bridge, West Virginia. “Coming hot on the heels of modernist long poem masterpieces like Eliot’s “The Wasteland” or Stein’s “Tender Buttons,” the poem’s deliberate lucidity isn’t just an aesthetic choice—it’s a political one,” Colleen Abel wrote in Ploughshares. “Rukeyser, from the beginning of “Book of the Dead,” seeks the reader’s participation in the journey to Gauley Bridge. The reader is implicated from the first section, “The Road,” in which Rukeyser calls outward to her audience: “These are roads you take when you think of your country.” The disaster Rukeyser is about to explore is a part of “our country” and the reader will have no choice but to confront it.",
    "Maya Angelou was one of America’s most acclaimed poets and storytellers, as well as a celebrated educator and civil rights activist. In ‘Come, And Be My Baby’, Angelou beautifully captures how overwhelming modern life can be and the comfort that love can provide during times of hardship — even if only for a moment. The raw honesty of Craig Arnold’s poetry makes ‘Bird-Understander’ an easy pick for our list of the most beautiful love poems. In this piece, Arnold recounts a moment with his partner that makes his love grow even stronger. The language is simple yet evocative, putting a strong metaphor in the reader’s mind and facilitating a deeper understanding of Arnold’s feelings. Best known for her alarmingly realistic dystopian novel The Handmaid’s Tale. ",
    "One of the most fascinating things about love is that it can come in so many different forms — platonic, passionate, or even patronizing. Margaret Atwood unflinchingly lays out some of these in her poem ‘Variations on the Word Love’. Whilst poems about heartbreak might not be as uplifting as those about the joys of love, they can be equally as beautiful and meaningful. The celestial extended metaphor of W.H. Auden’s ‘The More Loving One’ demonstrates this — though ultimately he would rather be ‘the more loving one’ himself, Auden perfectly encapsulates the pain of loss when love ends. Anne Bradstreet’s Puritan belief that marriage is a gift from God comes across strongly in ‘To My Dear and Loving Husband.’ ",
    "‘Always For The First Time’ is André Breton’s ode to a woman he has not met, but is willing to wait every day for. Breton was the French founder of the surrealist movement, which aimed to blur the lines between dreams and reality in art — explaining the rather whimsical nature of this beautiful love poem. Love doesn’t have to be confined to romance — love between friends can be just as strong and beautiful. In ‘Love and Friendship’, Emily Brontë compares romantic love to a rose — stunning but short-lived — and friendship to a holly tree which can endure all seasons. Next on our list of the most beautiful poems about love is ‘To Be in Love’ by Gwendolyn Brooks.",
    "Elizabeth Barrett Browning was a renowned Victorian poet who influenced the work of many later English-language poets, including Emily Dickinson. ‘How Do I Love Thee?’ is one of Browning’s most recognizable poems, and indeed one of the most famous love poems ever written — its ardent yet clear declaration of love has resonated with readers for over 150 years. Similar to Browning, Robert Burns’ profound love is evident in his poem ‘A Red, Red Rose’. Burns declares this love to be both passionate and refreshing — with each comparison, we see that even the loveliest language pales next to the depth of Burns’ ‘Luve’. Though its author was known for a life of adventure and scandal. ",
    "One of Portugal’s greatest poets, Luís Vaz de Camões is known for his lyrical poetry and dramatic epics. ‘Love is a fire that burns unseen’ is an example of the former, reflecting his numerous turbulent love affairs and how each brought a complex fusion of pleasure and pain. ‘Beautiful Signor’ is an entry from Cyrus Cassells’ poetry collection of the same name, which he dedicated to ‘Lovers everywhere’. Culturally set against the backdrop of the AIDS epidemic, the collection aims to remind people of the potent beauty of romantic love. Widely regarded as the ‘Father of English poetry’, Geoffrey Chaucer wrote some of the most renowned works of the English language. ",
    "Robert Creeley’s short but striking love poem aptly summarizes the feeling of never wanting to be apart from the person you love, almost making you forget what life was like before you met them. As one of America’s most prolific twentieth century poets, E.E. Cummings needs no introduction. Many of his poems centered around love and ‘[i carry your heart with me(i carry it in]’ is perhaps the best-known of them all. The rich imagery and intimate infatuation earns it a prominent spot on our list of the most beautiful love poems ever written. Another brilliant example of Cummings’ love poetry is [love is more thicker than forget].",
    "Yrsa Daley-Ward’s ‘Sthandwa sami (my beloved, isiZulu)’ is one of the most personal and revealing accounts of love on this list. The poem comes from her collection bone, which tackles some of the deepest aspects of humanity, including religion, desire, womanhood, race, and vulnerability. Guan Daosheng was a Chinese painter and poet of the early Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). ‘Married Love’ uses the image of clay figurines to represent two lovers being united as one through the sacred act of marriage, just as clay solidifies in a kiln. ‘Heart, we will forget him!’ aligns with the forceful nature of so many Emily Dickinson poems.",
    "The sparkling flirtation at the start of a new relationship is surely one of the most exciting parts of love. ‘Flirtation’ by Rita Dove eloquently captures this joy and anticipation, and is one of the most relatable poems about this aspect of love. In ‘Heart to Heart’, Rita Dove rejects the typical clichés that come with falling in love. With her down-to-earth approach to the topic, she assures the intended reader that although she may struggle to show her love, that doesn’t mean it’s not there. In 2009, Carol Ann Duffy made history when she was appointed the first female and openly lesbian British poet laureate.",
    "‘The Love Poem’ takes a different tack, depicting Duffy’s struggle to find the right words to describe her love. It comes from her 2005 collection Rapture, which charts the speaker’s journey through a love affair; at this stage, Duffy gets metafictional about love poetry, striving to explain the challenges of writing it (and invoking several other famous poems along the way). Faiz Ahmed Faiz wrote of love, politics, and community throughout his tumultuous life, and has been especially acknowledged for his contributions to traditional Urdu poetry.",
    "Janice Gould’s work homes in on themes of love and connection, with strong links to her identity as a Maidu lesbian. In ‘Six Sonnets: Crossing the West’, Gould equates her lover to a dream, never running short on ethereal ways to describe her... and mourning when she slips away, even temporarily. Contrasting love with the beauty of nature helps to create an unbreakable bond between the two. This comparison helps illustrate Joy Harjo’s feelings for her lover in her marvelous poem, ‘For Keeps’. ‘You Are the Penultimate Love of My Life’ is an unorthodox love poem, focusing on the realities rather than the fantasies of being in love."
